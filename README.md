# Zusi 3 TCP Protocol Library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/johannes/zusi3tcp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/johannes/zusi3tcp)

An implementation of the Zusi 3 TCP protocol in C++.

This is a fork of [jonathanp0's zus3tcp](https://github.com/jonathanp0/zusi3tcp) with *no* compatibility
using C++14 and a typesafe API.
